# DL-Based-Face-Emotion-Recognition
## *Implementation of Deep Learning Based Accurate Human Face Emotion Recognition*
	Face Emotion Recognition systems are generally assessed in two ways: subject independent or cross-database [12]. In
the subject independent assessment, the classifier is trained on one part of the database (training set) and assessed on
remaining images from the same database (testing set). In the cross- database method the classifier is trained on all images
of one database and evaluated on a different one, which is new to the classifier. As one database has same settings
(illumination, pose, resolution etc.) for all images, the former task is easier than the latter.<br/>
	Deep neural networks (DNN) are becoming popular in the approaches to solve the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)
problem. DNN’s are neural network architectures designed in order to improve the Bigdata handling of neural networks. As
computing power is growing by the day, DNN architectures are providing a learning architecture based on the development of
“brain-like” structures which can find complex patterns in text, images and sound. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the
latest techniques in the field of “deep learning” to solve the FER problem. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of
deep network which is traditionally being used by researchers studying computer vision and deep learning. DNN’s can perform
well in the cross-database assessments, by training a DNN for feature recognition and extraction a face emotion recognition
system can be designed in less time.__
	The goals of this project are to establish a model that can classify 7 basic emotions: happy, sad, surprise, angry,
disgust,neutral, and fear and to achieve the accuracy better than the baseline 14.29%. In the future, the model is
expected to perform wild emotion recognition that has more complex variance of condition than lab condition images. Facial
Emotion Expressions (FER) are very useful in different situations in real life because they give important insights for a
particular person. That is why they are studied in detail and applied in many systems. FER can be applied in different
applications such as: medical treatments, human resources, police investigation, education (on students while they are in a
lecture, customer service, journalism (during interviews) and many others.__
	This project proposes an approach for recognizing the category of facial expressions. Face Detection and Extraction
of expressions from facial images is useful in many applications, such as robotics vision, video surveillance, digital
cameras, security, and human-computer interaction. This project’s objective was to develop a facial expression recognition
system implementing the computer visions and enhancing the advanced feature extraction and classification in face expression
recognition. In this project, seven different facial expressions of different persons’ images from different datasets have
been analyzed. This project involves facial expression preprocessing of captured facial images followed by feature
extraction using feature extraction and classification of facial expressions based on training of datasets of facial images.
The model has an accuracy of 88.57% for emotion recognition and 99% accuracy for face recognition.__
